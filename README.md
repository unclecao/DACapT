# To be noted
Our work is the extension of tracking-by-detection method MDNet (https://github.com/hyeonseobnam/py-MDNet/). 
And thanks for their open source codes, we maintain the similar tracking procedures.

For the capsule construction, we are inspired by the work of https://github.com/unclecao/capsule-net-pytorch.
